# Liquid based Nitrous Oxide Quantification
The respository provides a practical tool wrapped as a Python package to estimated nitrous oxide emission using the liquid N<sub>2</sub>O sensor. It elaborated processes from data collection to mass trasnfer process estimation. It supports robust data preprocessing (IQR outlier removal, interpolation), nitrous oxide mass transfer coefficient (k<sub>L</sub>a<sub>N<sub>2</sub>O</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) flux estimations, and visualization of results.

## 📦 Features

- **Modular class-based API** via `LiquidQuantifier`
- **Automated preprocessing**: outlier removal, interpolation, and data smoothing  
- **k<sub>L</sub>a estimation** using time-series oxygen and N<sub>2</sub>O sensor data  
- **Interactive visualizations** for comparing pre- and post-treatment data  
- **Excel data input/output** with automated parsing

openpyxl

Clone this repository and install in editable (development) mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Julylle/Liquid-based-Nitrous-Oxide-Quantification-.git
cd Liquid-based-Nitrous-Oxide-Quantification-
python -m pip install -e .

from liquidbased_quantification import LiquidQuantifier

# Initialize model with your Excel data
model = LiquidQuantifier("data/Monitoring_Data_Example.xlsx")

# Run full analysis pipeline
results = model.run_pipeline(show_plots=True)

# Reinstall in editable mode
python -m pip install -e .
```

## 🧩 Example Data

A placeholder Excel file is included under data/Monitoring_Data_Example.xlsx.
Replace this file with your actual monitoring dataset.
Your dataset should contain timestamped measurements of dissolved oxygen, N₂O, and related process variables.
Your dataset should keep the same header and unit as the provided template.
